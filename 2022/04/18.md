## JavaScript

### 1. undefined vs null

- null is an assigned value. It means nothing.
- undefined means a variable has been declared but not defined yet.

### 2. var vs let vs const

|              | var                                 | let                                 | const                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| scope        | function scope                      | block scope                         | block scope                           |
| reassignment | can be changed through reassignment | can be changed through reassignment | can't be changed through reassignment |
| declartion   | can be declared multiple times      | can't be declared multiple times    | can't be declared multiple times      |
| hoisting     | hoisted                             | not hoisted                         | not hoisted                           |

### 3. Function Declarations vs Function Expressions

Function Declarations

- Function declarations are named functions
- Function declarations load before any code is executed
- Function declarations can be hoisted (code moves to the top of its scope before code execution)

```js
function name() {
  ...
}
```

Function Expressions

- Function expressions are anonymous function that is assigned to variable
- Function expressions load only when the interpreter reaches that line of code
- Function expressions can't be hoisted

```js
var name = function () {
  ...
};
```
