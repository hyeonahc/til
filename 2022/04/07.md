## React

### 1. Manage state in class componenet

1. Create `this.state = {key: value}` inside of constructor to start using state
2. When you want use the state value, you can access with `this.state.key`
3. When you want to modify the state value, use `setState({key: value})` and put the new value of key

### 2. Manage state in functional component

1. Create useState snippet `const [first, setfirst] = useState(second)`
2. first is the state name, setfirst is the function to modify the state value and second inside of useState is the initial value of state
3. when you wnat to use the state value, you can access with `first`
4. When you want to modify the state value, use `setfirst(new value)` and put the new value inside of setfirst function

### 3. What is ref

- When you want to access DOM element in HTML, you put id and select DOM using getElementByID in JS
- In react, you put ref instead of id

### 4. Why React use ref instead of id?

React component is like a piece of block that is reusable. If the component reused with id attribute, id attribute also reused as many as the componet reused. And it is not the best practice to use the same id. Unlike id, ref works within the same component.
