## Git

### 1. How to work in a team with git

**Step 1**: Create issues and assign them to team members<br>
**Step 2**: Create branch and work (solve the issue)<br>
**Step 3**: When the work is done, merge all the branches<br>
**Step 4**: Pull request to team manager<br>
**Step 5**: If there is a merge conflict, review and update the code then commit again<br>

### 2. What we write in GitHub issue

1. additional feature creation
2. bug report
3. enhancement

### 3. what is branch?

- Branch is like a pointer that moves easily between commit to commit
- Branch is derived from a commmit that looks like a copy version
- Branch helps to work in one project with multiple people

### 4. When to use branch

- When you want to work in the same repository with a team
- When you want to have independent work space for feature development

### 5. git branch command line

- Create new branch: `git branch <branch name>`
- Switch to different branch: `git switch <branch name>`
- Create new branch and select the created one: `git checkout -b <branch name>`
- Show the available local branch list: `git branch`
- Show the available remote branch list: `git branch -r`
- Show the available local and remote branch list: `git branch -a`
- Delete branch: `git branch -D <branch name>`
- Push the branch to remote repository: `git push origin <branch name>`
- Show the difference of two branches: `git diff <branch name1> <branch name2>`

### 6. How merge conflict happens

1. The same file in two branches is modified
2. when the same file in two branches merged to one same branch, the conflict happens
3. When the same file is modified by two branches, git can't decide what code to keep so it's asking the user what to do

### 7. How to fix merge conflict

1. The user reviews the code and modify them
2. Delete <<<<<<< HEAD , ======= , >>>>>>>
3. Commit the edited file

### 8. Pull Request (PR)

- Let others know you pushed something on repository
- Once it is approved, your code will be merged
- It is important to keep your working branch until it is merged in case there is request

### 9. fork

- Fork is copying the 3rd party's repository to your space to work
- Fork allows to develop the code independently (without affecting to the original code)
- If you want to merge your code, you should pull request and wait
