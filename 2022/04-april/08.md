## React

### 1. Why should we not update the state directly in React?

When React updates state, we should keep the immutability. An immutable value or object cannot be changed, so every update creates new value, leaving the old one untouched. If we update state directly, React will not sense the update and eventually don't rerender the component.

### 2. So how can we update the state properly?

Use array method to update state to keep the immutability.

- Add data: concat, spread operator
- modify data: map
- remove date: filter
