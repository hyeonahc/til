### package.json vs package-lock.json

- The package.json file is the heart of any Node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts, and identify the entry point to our package.
- package-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the node_modules tree, or package. json
