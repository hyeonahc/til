## JavaScript

### 1. Default parameters (ES6)

Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.

```
function sayHello(name = "user") {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

sayHello();
// "Hello, user!"

sayHello("maple")
// "Hello, maple!"
```

### 2. Object key value shorthand (ES6)

The object literal property value shorthand was introduced in ES6 to make the object initialization shorter.

It allows us to define an object whose keys have the same names as the variables passed-in as properties, by simply passing the variables.

```
let a = "maple";
let b = 20;
let c = ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"];

let obj = { a, b, c };
/*
object above is the same as below
obj = {
  a: a,
  b: b,
  c: c
}
*/

console.log(obj.a)
// "maple"
```

### 3. What is open source software?

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
